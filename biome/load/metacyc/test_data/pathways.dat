COMMON-NAME - biotin biosynthesis from 8-amino-7-oxononanoate II
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: BIOTIN "Biotin"| is a water soluble, heterocyclic cofactor for a small number of enzymes that facilitate the transfer of CO<sub>2</sub> during carboxylation, decarboxylation, and transcarboxylation reactions involved in fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolism |CITS: [SHELLHAMMER90][11706201][15012185]|. 
/The biotin-requiring enzymes identified so far (including |FRAME: ACETYL-COA-CARBOXYLMULTI-CPLX|,
/|FRAME: CPLX66-17|, |FRAME: CPLX-5203|, and |FRAME: CPLX-6001|) play essential roles in cell metabolism
/|CITS: [8676868]|. 
/Biotin may also have functions in metabolism other than its mere catalytic role as an enzyme cofactor. It has been
/shown that biotin also carries out non-catalytic functions in the expression of methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase
/in |FRAME:TAX-3701| biotin-auxotroph mutants, by modulating and regulating gene expression |CITS: [12644697]|. 
/
/Biotin biosynthesis is found in plants, bacteria, and certain fungi. Although animals and most fungi cannot synthesize their own biotin, a daily intake is required for normal growth and development |CITS: [11322938]|. 
/The biotin biosynthetic pathway has been explored in detail in bacteria. Sequencing analysis and some experimental evidence suggests that the steps in bacterial biotin synthesis are conserved in plants |CITS: [11322938]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Biotin consists of two fused heterocyclic rings and a |FRAME: VALERATE| side chain, derived from a |FRAME: CPD-205|-like structure. The early steps of the pathway are responsible for the synthesis of the precursor pimelate moiety, and are described in the pathways |FRAME: PWY-6519| and |FRAME: PWY-6578|. The late steps of the pathway, which are responsible for forming the two rings in the structure of biotin, are described here.
/
/The pathway described here is different from that described in |FRAME: PWY0-1507| since the |FRAME: TAX-1423|enzyme that catayzes the first step cannot use |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| as an amino-group donor, and uses |FRAME:LYS| instead |CITS: [15880481]|. The rest of the pathway is identical: |FRAME: EC-6.3.3.3| catalyzes the first ring closure by a carboxylation reaction that does not require biotin as a prosthetic group, forming |FRAME: DETHIOBIOTIN| |CITS: [4921568]|. This intermediate is then converted to the final product by |FRAME: EC-2.8.1.6|. This enzyme inserts a sulfur atom between C6 and C9 of dethiobiotin in a |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE|-dependent reaction. It has not been possible to reconstitute a catalytic reaction of this enzyme <i>in vitro</i>, and there is some uncertainty regarding the reaction mechanism, cofactor requirements, and the source of the sulfur atom |CITS: [15850974]|. However, recent experiments have suggested that a |FRAME: CPD-6| of the enzyme is the source of the sulfur atom.  Consistent with its proposed role as the sulfur donor, degradation of the [2Fe-2S] cluster |CITS: [14967042]| as well as exchange of sulfur atoms between the [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters |CITS: [16533066]| is observed during turnover of the enzyme.
/
/Another difference between the biosynthetic pathways of Gram-negative bacteria (|FRAME: BIOTIN-BIOSYNTHESIS-PWY|) and Gram-positive bacteria (|FRAME: PWY-5005|) is upstream of the precursor |FRAME: 8-AMINO-7-OXONONANOATE|. Gram-positive bacteria generate |FRAME: 8-AMINO-7-OXONONANOATE| from |FRAME:CPD-205| as described in |FRAME: PWY-6578|, while in Gram-negative bacteria |FRAME: 8-AMINO-7-OXONONANOATE| is synthesized from |FRAME: MALONYL-COA| in a pathway described in |FRAME: PWY-6519| |CITS: [20693992]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: THIAMINE "Thiamin"|, also known as vitamin B1, is known to play a fundamental role in energy metabolism.  Its discovery followed from the original early research on the anti-beriberi factor found in rice bran.  Beriberi, a neurological disease, was particularly prevalent in Asia, where the refining of rice resulted in the removal of the thiamin-containing husk |CITS: [Begley96]|.  The anti-beriberi substance was crystallized from rice polishings by Jansen and Donath in 1926 |CITS: [Jansen26]|.  The structure and synthesis of thiamin were reported by Williams |CITS: [Williams38]|.  The compound was named thiamine when it was believed to be an amine.  When it became clear that it is not an amine, the 'e' was dropped, and the name was changed to thiamin |CITS: [16550223]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Since the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| is a very complex process, many organisms possess various salvage pathways thart enable them to rescue thiamin fragments obtained from the environment.  This pathway describes the salvage of base-degraded thiamin compounds, and starts with |FRAME: CPD-13577|, a compound that is generated by base-mediated degradation of the thiazolium moiety of thiamin |CITS: [17618314]|.
/
/|FRAME: CPD-13577 "Formylaminopyrimidine"| is transported into the cell and deformylated by |FRAME: BSU15350-MONOMER|.  The resulting |FRAME: CPD-13578| is converted to |FRAME: HMP| (HMP) by |FRAME: BSU11650-MONOMER "4-amino-5-aminomethyl-2-methylpyrimidine hydrolase"| (TenA, thiaminase II).  The salvaged HMP is then phosphorylated to form |FRAME: AMINO-HYDROXYMETHYL-METHYLPYRIMIDINE-PP|, which is incorporated into the <i>de novo</i> thiamin biosynthetic pathway |CITS: [18054064]|.

/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The active form of thiamin is |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE|. The non-phosphorylated form |FRAME: THIAMINE| is not produced as an intermediate in the <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic route, but is found in the environment as a degradation product.
/
/Many microbes possess transporters that allow them to import thiamin |CITS: [16291685]|, as well as salvage pathways that regenerate the active form. One such pathway, which is described here, consists of the direct conversion of |FRAME: THIAMINE| to |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| |CITS: [15150256]|.
/
/This single-step thiamin salvage pathway was originally thought to occur only in eukaryotes, but the discovery of the enzyme in |FRAME: TAX-1423| revealed that it is also used by bacteria.

TYPES - Pyrimidine-Ribonucleosides-Degradation
COMMON-NAME - UTP and CTP dephosphorylation II
COMMENT - The key enzyme of this pathway is apyrase (|FRAME: EC-3.6.1.5|).
/Apyrases are active against both di- and triphosphate nucleotides (NDPs and NTPs) and hydrolyze NTPs to nucleotide monophosphates (NMPs) in two distinct successive phosphate-releasing steps, with NDPs as intermediates.
/They are widely distributed in eukaryotic cells from yeast |CITS: [10409709]| to mammals |CITS: [9556635]|, but similar enzymes have also been reported in bacteria |CITS: [15576788]|. They differ from ATPases, which specifically hydrolyze ATP, by hydrolyzing both ATP and ADP (although the relative rates of ATP and ADP hydrolysis differ depending on the species) |CITS: [8611638]|.
/Apyrases can be divided into ecto-apyrases, in which the catalytic domain is outside the cell |CITS: [7721538]|, and endo-apyrases, with the catalytic site inside the cell |CITS: [8611638]|. Ecto-apyrases participate in neurotransmission, blood platelet aggregation, and pressure regulation. Endo-apyrases are involved in protein glycosylation and sugar level control and in regulation of membrane integrity. 
/
/Apyrases are well studied in lower |CITS: [8703025][10409709][12686557]| and higher eukaryotes |CITS: [9364474][11985621][15122917][16752921]|, and less so in plants |CITS: [8579614][Steinebrunner00][17434987]|. They appear to be absent from bacteria and archaea.
/
/Apyrases are involved in many functions, and the pathway may be utilized in different capacities depending on specific cases.
/One case that has been studied involves protein and lipid glycosylation within the Golgi apparatus. NDP-sugars are synthesized in the cytosol and translocated into the Golgi lumen via specific membrane carriers. After transfer of sugar residues to proteins and lipids by galactosyltransferases, the resulting NDPs is likely hydrolyzed by the apyrases to NMPs. In this way, the NDPs, which are highly inhibitory to galactosyltransferases, do not accumulate in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. The NMPs then exit the Golgi lumen by exchange with new cytosolic NDP-sugars via an anti-porter |CITS: [9204706][10409709]|.

COMMENT-INTERNAL - C. Fulcher 10/1/04
/
/The EcoCyc lactose degradation III pathway (BGALACT-PWY) was enhanced by adding pathway comments, gene comments, and references in EcoCyc.
/
/In MetaCyc pathway lactose degradation III, Rhizobium meliloti was added as a second species.  It was transferred from MetaCyc lactose degradation II, 
/(LACTOSEUTIL-PWY) for the following reasons:  The original MetaCyc lactose degradation II pathway appeared to be imported from the WIT database, and was 
/curated for Rhizobium meliloti Rm2011.  The last update was dated 12/11/03.  However, of the 3 reactions in the pathway, only the beta-galactosidase reaction was 
/curated.  Review of the experimental literature suggests that this pathway is probably an Agrobacterium tumefaciens pathway, due to the formation of 3-ketolactose.  
/Several references indicate that formation of this compound is a characteristic of Agrobacterium tumefaciens biovar 1 (PMID 7581688) and in PMIDs 1630315, 838689, 
/and 6323925. 
/
/The Rhizobium literature suggests that lactose is the substrate for the beta-galactosidase reaction, with beta-D-galactose and beta-D-glucose as products.  No 
/references were found that characterize enzymes for further metabolism of beta-D-galactose in Rhizobium meliloti.  Although the complete genome sequence of of a 
/different strain of this organism has been published, relevant enzymes were only computationally predicted (see 
/http://bioinfo.genopole-toulouse.prd.fr/annotation/iANT/bacteria/rhime/). 
/
/The following transfers were made from LACTOSEUTIL-PWY TO BGALACT-PWY:  the Rhizobium enzyme and associated information; gene and associated information; 
/previous comments (the middle paragraph); and references.  
/
/Additional pathway comments (first and third paragraphs) and gene comments (second paragraph) were added.  Updates were also added for the enzyme (second 
/paragraph and data).  Associated references were also added.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Thiols are compounds that play a major role in the detoxification of stress-inducing factors.  Pathogenic bacteria live in a particularly hostile environment, in which the host deliberately generates toxins, including reactive oxygen species, to destroy the invading organism.  Thus thiols are particularly important for the survival of these organisms.  While |FRAME: GLUTATHIONE| is the major low-molecular-weight thiol in eukaryotic organisms, Gram-negative bacteria and some Gram-positive bacteria, it is not universal |CITS: [417060]|.  In some organisms other thiols have taken its role, including |FRAME: CoM|, |FRAME: TRYPANOTHIONE|, ergothioneine, |FRAME: CPD1G-2|, and the ovothiols. 
/
/The small thiol |FRAME: CPD8J2-3| has been discovered in a variety of Gram-positive bacteria, including <i>Deinococcus radiodurans</i>, <i>Bacillus anthracis</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> |CITS: [19578333]|.  Genes similar to those of the <i>B. subtilis</i> biosynthetic pathway were also discovered in the &delta;-proteobacterium <i>Myxococcus xanthus</i> and the halophilic alkalithermophile <i>Natranaerobius thermophilus</i> |CITS: [20308541]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/A pathway for the biosynthesis of bacillithiol was proposed based on parallels to the |FRAME: PWY1G-0| pathway, and candidate enzymes were identified by bioinformatic analysis.  The function of the first enzyme of the pathway, |FRAME: BSU22460-MONOMER|, was confirmed by assays of the purified protein and its mutant phenotype.  Two acetylases with partially redundant function catalyze the second reaction, deacetylation of |FRAME: CPD8J2-1|.  The last enzyme of the pathway, a cysteine-adding enzyme, was identified by its mutant phenotype |CITS: [20308541]|.
/
/The redox buffer provided by bacillithiol protects the cells against NaOCl stress |CITS: [21749987]|.

CITATIONS - :EV-COMP-AINF:3588942210:keseler
CITATIONS - 23586652:EV-EXP:3577295074:keseler
COMMENT - Kanosamine (3-amino-3-deoxy-D-glucose) is an antibiotic known to be produced by <i>Bacillus cereus</i> |CITS: [8702302]| and other bacteria |CITS: [3569498][7429991]|. 
/
/<i>Bacillus subtilis</i> encodes three gene products, |FRAME: BSU10530-MONOMER NtdC|, |FRAME: BSU10550-MONOMER NtdA| and |FRAME: BSU10540-MONOMER NtdB|, that were thought to be involved in the biosynthesis of 3,3'-neotrehalosadiamine (NTD), an unusual nonreducing disaccharide.  Vetter et al. (|CITS: [23586652]|) have now shown that these enzymes in fact synthesize kanosamine via a novel pathway.  In an NAD-dependent reaction, |FRAME: BSU10530-MONOMER| dehydrogenates |FRAME: D-glucopyranose-6-phosphate D-glucose-6-phosphate| at the 3 position to form |FRAME: 3-oxo-D-glucose-6-phosphate|.  |FRAME: BSU10550-MONOMER| subsequently transfers the amine group of L-glutamate to this keto group, forming |FRAME: CPD-10225|, and |FRAME: BSU10540-MONOMER| hydrolyzes the 6-phosphate group to produce |FRAME: CPD-10224|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: BIOTIN "Biotin"| is a water soluble, heterocyclic cofactor for a small number of enzymes that facilitate the transfer of CO<sub>2</sub> during carboxylation, decarboxylation and transcarboxylation reactions involved in fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolism |CITS: [SHELLHAMMER90][11706201][15012185]|.
/The biotin-requiring enzymes identified so far (including |FRAME: ACETYL-COA-CARBOXYLMULTI-CPLX|,
/|FRAME: CPLX66-17|, |FRAME: CPLX-5203|, and |FRAME: CPLX-6001|) play essential roles in cell metabolism
/|CITS: [8676868]|.
/Biotin may also have functions in metabolism other than its mere catalytic role as an enzyme cofactor. It has been shown that biotin also carries out non-catalytic functions in the expression of methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase in |FRAME:TAX-3701| biotin-auxotroph mutants, by modulating and regulating gene expression |CITS: [12644697]|.
/
/Biotin biosynthesis is found in plants, bacteria and certain fungi. Although animals and most fungi cannot synthesize their own biotin, a daily intake is required for normal growth and development |CITS: [11322938]|. While the biotin biosynthetic pathway has been explored in detail only in bacteria, ongoing success in sequencing whole genomes from other organisms has provided evidence that the general steps in bacterial biotin synthesis are conserved in plants |CITS: [11322938]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Despite the importance and prevalance of biotin, its detailed biosynthetic pathway remained enigmatic for over 70 years. Biotin consists of two fused heterocyclic rings and a |FRAME: VALERATE| side chain, and is derived from |FRAME: CPD-205|. The early steps of the pathway, which are described here, are limited to the synthesis of the precursor pimelate moiety. The late steps of the pathway, which are responsible for forming the two rings in the structure of biotin, are described in |FRAME: PWY0-1507|.
/
/The Gram-positive bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1423| uses different enzymes/pathways for synthesizing the pimelate moiety either by salvage or <i>de novo</i>. In the salvage pathway, externally-provided pimelate is activated to |FRAME: CPD-558| (see |FRAME: PWY-6578|). In the <i>de novo</i> pathway, which is described here, the pimelate moiety can be generated from a range of |FRAME: Long-Chain-Acyl-ACPs long-chain acyl-[acp]"| molecules. 
/
/The key enzyme in this pathway is |FRAME: BSU30190-MONOMER|, encoded by the |FRAME: BSU30190| gene. This P450 enzyme catalyzes the oxidative C-C bond cleavage of long chain acyl-[acp]s, forming |FRAME: Pimeloyl-ACPs pimeloyl-[acp]| |CITS: [11368323][20658980]|. Like other cytochrome P450 enzymes, BioI uses the cysteine-ligated active site heme to activate molecular oxygen by two flavodoxin-mediated reductions with NADPH. The proposed mechanism involves four sub-reactions, during which two oxygen atoms are incorporated at position 7 and 8 of the acyl-[acp] molecule, followed by cleavage and incorporation of a third oxygen atom to form |FRAME: 7-Oxoheptanoyl-ACPs "7-oxoheptanoyl-[acp]"|, and its subsequent oxidation to |FRAME: Pimeloyl-ACPs "pimeloyl-[acp]"| (it is still not clear whether the last reaction is spontaneous or catalyzed by the enzyme). The mechanism is similar to that of |FRAME: 1.14.15.6-RXN "EC 1.14.15.6, cholesterol monooxygenase (side-chain-cleaving)"| |CITS: [20658980]|. Although free fatty acids can be processed by BioI <i>in vitro</i>, the physiological substrates are thought to be acyl-[acp]s |CITS: [11368323]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: THIAMINE "Thiamin"|, also known as vitamin B1, is known to play a fundamental role in energy metabolism. Its discovery followed from the original early research on the anti-beriberi factor found in rice bran. Beriberi, a neurological disease, was particularly prevalent in Asia, where the refining of rice resulted in the removal of the thiamin-containing husk |CITS: [Begley96]|.
/The anti-beriberi substance was crystallized from rice polishings by Jansen and Donath in 1926 |CITS:[Jansen26]|. The structure and synthesis of thiamin were reported by Williams |CITS:[Williams38]|.
/The compound was named thiamine when it was believed to be an amine. When it became clear that it is not an amine, the 'e' was dropped, and the name was changed to thiamin |CITS:[16550223]|.
/
/Thiamin biosynthesis in bacteria is composed of the separate formation of the pyrimidine and thiazole moieties, which are subsequently coupled to form |FRAME: THIAMINE-P| (see for example |FRAME: PWY-6893|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This pathway describes the synthesis of the pyrimidine moiety of thiamin. Starting with |FRAME: 5-PHOSPHORIBOSYL-5-AMINOIMIDAZOLE|, an intermdiate in purine biosynthesis, two enzymatic steps, catalyzed by |FRAME: BSU08790 "ThiC"| and |FRAME: BSU11710 "ThiD"|, produce |FRAME: AMINO-HYDROXYMETHYL-METHYLPYRIMIDINE-PP|.
/The first reaction is one of the most complicated rearrangement reactions known. The ThiC enzyme belongs to the radical SAM family, all members of which utilize |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| (SAM) to generate an 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical that in turn serves as an oxidant for a wide variety of enzymatic reactions |CITS: [18953358]|. The first stage of catalysis is the reduction of SAM to produce |FRAME: MET| and a 5-deoxyadenosyl radical, which is generated at the active site. The radical reacts directly with the substrate to catalyze a complex rearrangement reaction that includes two iterative hydrogen atom abstractions (which necessitates the regeneration of the radical following the first abstraction). C1' and C3' of the substrate, which are not inorporated into the product, are converted to formate and carbon monoxide, respectively |CITS: [20886485]|.
/
/The second enzyme, ThiD, is a simple kinase. It is a bifunctional enzyme, and can also phosphorylate |FRAME: HMP|, as a part of a thiamin salvage pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-6897|) |CITS: [14973012]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: THIAMINE "Thiamin"|, also known as vitamin B1, is known to play a fundamental role in energy metabolism. Its discovery followed from the original early research on the anti-beriberi factor found in rice bran. Beriberi, a neurological disease, was particularly prevalent in Asia, where the refining of rice resulted in the removal of the thiamin-containing husk |CITS: [Begley96]|.
/The anti-beriberi substance was crystallized from rice polishings by Jansen and Donath in 1926 |CITS:[Jansen26]|. The structure and synthesis of thiamin were reported by Williams |CITS:[Williams38]|.
/The compound was named thiamine when it was believed to be an amine. When it became clear that it is not an amine, the 'e' was dropped, and the name was changed to thiamin |CITS:[16550223]|.
/
/Thiamin biosynthesis in bacteria is composed of the separate formation of the pyrimidine and thiazole moieties, which are subsequently coupled to form |FRAME: THIAMINE-P| (see |FRAME: PWY-6893|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This pathway describes only the synthesis of the thiazole moiety of thiamin. Different variations of this pathway exist, this particular pathway describes the pathway that occurs in |FRAME: TAX-1423|.
/
/The biosynthesis of the thiazole moiety is complex. In |FRAME: TAX-1423| it involves six proteins, the products of the |FRAME: BSU29590|, |FRAME: BSU11700|, |FRAME: BSU11680|,  |FRAME: BSU11670|, |FRAME: BSU11690| and |FRAME: BSU11660| genes. 
/
/The process begins when the |FRAME: ThiF-Proteins "ThiF protein"| activates |FRAME: Thi-S| by adenylation of its carboxy terminus, generating |FRAME:Adenylated-ThiS-Proteins|.  |FRAME: BSU29590-MONOMER IscS|, a protein that is also involved in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters, catalyzes the transfer of a sulfur atom from cysteine to the adenylated ThiS, generating |FRAME: Thiocarboxyadenylated-ThiS-Proteins|.
/
/In a parallel reaction, |FRAME: CPLX-8352| (ThiO) forms |FRAME: CPD-12279| from |FRAME: GLY|.
/
/The main reaction of this pathway is a very complex reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: BSU11690-MONOMER| (ThiG), that requires three inputs: |FRAME: Thiocarboxyadenylated-ThiS-Proteins|,  |FRAME: DEOXYXYLULOSE-5P| (DXP) and |FRAME: CPD-12279|.
/For many years the product of this reaction was assumed to be |FRAME: THZ| (thiazole). However, recent work performed with the thiazole synthase from |FRAME: TAX-1423| has shown that the actual product is the thiazole tautomer |FRAME: CPD-13575| |CITS: [19216519]|.  A dedicated |FRAME: BSU11660-MONOMER| converts this product into a different tautomer, |FRAME: CPD-13576|, which is the actual substrate for the thiamine-phosphate diphosphorylase enzyme |CITS: [21534620]|.
/
/There are a few differences between the pathways in |FRAME: TAX-1423| and |FRAME: TAX-83333|. |FRAME: CPD-12279| is formed from |FRAME: GLY| rather than from |FRAME: TYR| |CITS: [12627963]|. The |FRAME:BSU29580 ThiI| protein of Bacillus does not seem to be essential or even participate in this pathway |CITS: [14567704]|, and |FRAME: BSU11660-MONOMER| does not exist in E. coli |CITS: [21534620]|.

COMMON-NAME - glucuronoarabinoxylan degradation
COMMENT - |FRAME: Glucuronoxylans Glucuronoxylans| are a component of |FRAME: Hemicelluloses|. They are linear polymers of &beta;-D-xylopyranosyl units linked by (1&rarr;4) glycosidic bonds, with many of the xylose units substituted with 2, 3 or 2,3-linked galacturonate residues. Many of the D-glucuronosyl units are methylated at position 4. Angiosperm (hardwood) glucuronoxylans also have a high rate of substitution (7080%) by acetyl groups, at position 2 and/or 3 of the &beta;-D-xylopyranosyl.
/
/
/|FRAME: Glucuronoarabinoxylans Glucuronoarabinoxylans|, typically found in softwood, have the same xylan backbone as in |FRAME: Glucuronoxylans glucuronoxylans|, but about one in ten &beta;-D-xylopyranosyl residue is substituted by &alpha;-L-arabinofuranosyl at position 3. Unlike glucuronoxylans, glucuronoarabinoxylans are not acetylated |CITS: [15944805]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: THIAMINE "Thiamin"|, also known as vitamin B1, is known to play a fundamental role in energy metabolism.  Its discovery followed from the original early research on the anti-beriberi factor found in rice bran.  Beriberi, a neurological disease, was particularly prevalent in Asia, where the refining of rice resulted in the removal of the thiamin-containing husk |CITS: [Begley96]|.  The anti-beriberi substance was crystallized from rice polishings by Jansen and Donath in 1926 |CITS: [Jansen26]|.  The structure and synthesis of thiamin were reported by Williams |CITS: [Williams38]|.  The compound was named thiamine when it was believed to be an amine.  When it became clear that it is not an amine, the 'e' was dropped, and the name was changed to thiamin |CITS: [16550223]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The thiamin biosynthesis pathway illustrated here has been studied in |FRAME: TAX-1423|.  There are several differences between the pathways employed by |FRAME: TAX-1423| and by |FRAME: TAX-562|. 
/
/Thiamin biosynthesis in bacteria is composed of the separate formation of the pyrimidine and thiazole moieties, which are subsequently coupled to form |FRAME: THIAMINE-P|.  A final phosphorylation reaction yields the biologically active form, |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE|. 
/
/The biosynthesis of the thiazole moiety is complex.  In |FRAME: TAX-1423| it involves six proteins, the products of the |FRAME: BSU29590|, |FRAME: BSU11700|, |FRAME: BSU11680|, |FRAME: BSU11670|, |FRAME: BSU11690| and |FRAME: BSU11660| genes. 
/
/The process begins when the |FRAME: ThiF-Proteins "ThiF protein"| activates |FRAME: Thi-S| by adenylation of its carboxy terminus, generating |FRAME:Adenylated-ThiS-Proteins|.  |FRAME: BSU29590-MONOMER IscS|, a protein that is also involved in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters, catalyzes the transfer of a sulfur atom from cysteine to the adenylated ThiS, generating |FRAME: Thiocarboxyadenylated-ThiS-Proteins|.
/
/In a parallel reaction, |FRAME: CPLX-8352| (ThiO) forms |FRAME: CPD-12279| from |FRAME: GLY|.
/
/The main reaction in the thiazole synthesis pathway is a very complex reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: BSU11690-MONOMER| (ThiG), that requires three inputs: |FRAME: Thiocarboxyadenylated-ThiS-Proteins|, |FRAME: DEOXYXYLULOSE-5P| (DXP) and |FRAME: CPD-12279|.  For many years the product of this reaction was assumed to be |FRAME: THZ| (thiazole).  However, recent work performed with the thiazole synthase from |FRAME: TAX-1423| has shown that the actual product is the thiazole tautomer |FRAME: CPD-13575| |CITS: [19216519]|.  A dedicated |FRAME: BSU11660-MONOMER| converts this product into a different tautomer, |FRAME: CPD-13576|, which is the actual substrate for the thiamine-phosphate diphosphorylase enzyme |CITS: [21534620]|.
/
/The biosynthesis of the pyrimidine moiety of thiamin is also not simple.  The first step is one of the most complicated rearrangement reactions known.  The ThiC enzyme belongs to the radical SAM family, all members of which utilize |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| (SAM) to generate an 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical that in turn serves as an oxidant for a wide variety of enzymatic reactions |CITS: [18953358]|.  The first stage of catalysis is the reduction of SAM to produce |FRAME: MET| and a 5-deoxyadenosyl radical, which is generated at the active site.  The radical reacts directly with the substrate to catalyze a complex rearrangement reaction that includes two iterative hydrogen atom abstractions (which necessitates the regeneration of the radical following the first abstraction).  C1' and C3' of the substrate, which are not inorporated into the product, are converted to formate and carbon monoxide, respectively |CITS: [20886485]|.  The second enzyme, ThiD, is a simple kinase, and produces |FRAME: AMINO-HYDROXYMETHYL-METHYLPYRIMIDINE-PP| |CITS: [14973012]|.
/
/The last part of the pathway consists of the coupling of the two moieties of thiamin, forming |FRAME: THIAMINE-P|, and its phosphorylation to the biologically active form, |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE|.  Although it is not absolutely clear at this time, it is possible that |FRAME: BSU38290-MONOMER| acts <i>in vivo</i> on different substrates in different organisms |CITS: [21534620]|.

TYPES - Rhamnogalacturonan-Degradation
COMMON-NAME - rhamnogalacturonan type I degradation II (bacteria)
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: Pectin Pectin| is an important component of the plant cell wall. Pectin contains polygalacturonan as a linear component and |FRAME: Rhamnogalacturonans-I  "rhamnogalacturonan type I"| (RG-I) and rhamnogalacturonan type II (RG-II) as branched chains |CITS: [16660529][9067088]|. 
/
/|FRAME: Rhamnogalacturonans-I  "Rhamnogalacturonan type I "| consists of repeating &alpha;-(1,2)-|FRAME:L-rhamnose|-&alpha;-(1,4)-|FRAME: D-GALACTURONATE| disaccharide units. About half of the Rha residues are substituted with side chains of various neutral oligosaccharides such as arabinans, galactans, and arabinogalactans |CITS: [16661590 ]|. RG-II contains polygalacturonan as a backbone and a complex of approximately 30 monosaccharides, including rare sugars such as apiose and aceric acid as a side chain |CITS: [8798473]|.
/
/Many plant-pathogenic fungi and bacteria produce enzymes responsible for plant cell wall degradation. The degradation pathway for the polygalacturonan region in pectin has been extensively characterized in plant-pathogenic microbes such as |FRAME: TAX-556| |CITS: [8905080]| and |FRAME: TAX-5052| species |CITS: [11729262]|. A large number of polygalacturonan-degrading enzymes (i.e., pectin lyase, pectate lyase, and polygalacturonase) have also been identified from many fungi and bacteria. However, studies of the microbial degradation system for the RG region in pectin have been limited. One such system has been reported in |FRAME: TAX-5053| (see |FRAME: PWY-6769|). Another one, studied in |FRAME: TAX-224308|, is described here.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The saprophytic bacterium |FRAME: TAX-224308| grows well withn plant cell wall polysaccharides such as pectin, olygalacturonan, and |FRAME: Rhamnogalacturonans-I  "rhamnogalacturonan type I "| (RGI-) as the carbon source. The <i>yes</i> gene cluster is one of three clusters that are induced during growth on RG I. 
/
/Among the proteins encoded by the <i>yes</i> cluster, |FRAME: G-12555| and |FRAME: G-12672| encode two RG lyases whose combined action releases disaccharides from RG-I. YesW is a |FRAME: MONOMER-16263| that is secreted by the cells, which catalyzes the initial cleavage of the RG-I main chain. The resultant oligosaccharides, which have an unsaturated saccharide at the non-reducing end, are converted to disaccharides through the extracellular enzyme |FRAME: MONOMER-16402| (YesX). The disaccharides are finally degraded into their constituent monosaccharides by the reaction of two intracellular enzyme, the unsaturated galacturonyl hydrolases |FRAME: MONOMER-16265 YesR| and YteR |CITS: [17449691]|.
/
/The <i>yes</i> gene cluster is also induced in |FRAME: TAX-86029| when grown with soy beans. This is an important industrial strain used for the production of <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natto">natto</A>, a Japanese fermented soy beans dish |CITS: [17449691]|.

COMMON-NAME - <i>myo</i>-, <i>chiro</i>- and <i>scillo</i>-inositol degradation
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: Inositols Inositol| is the generic name for 1,2,3,4,5,6-cyclohexanehexol. Epimerization of the six hydroxyl groups results in nine stereoisomers.
/
/|FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL "<i>myo</i>-Inositol"| is the physiologically most common stereoisomer and is distributed abundantly (but not universally) throughout the biological system. It is an essential polyol in eukaryotes, where its phospholipid derivative |FRAME: L-1-phosphatidyl-inositols phosphatidylinositol| (PI) is an important constituent of phospholipid membranes. PI is also cleaved by phospholipase C to generate inositol phosphate (IP) and diacyglycerol, both of which are central cell signalling molecules.
/
/|FRAME: CPD-8050 "<i>scyllo</i>-Inositol"| is a relatively rare form of inositol but is sometimes found in organisms. It has been documented in |FRAME: TAX-13422| buds |CITS: [10830508]| and in |FRAME: TAX-4513 barley| seeds, where it is present in phosphatidylinositol |CITS: [7755633]|. The phosphatidylinositol synthase of |FRAME: TAX-5919| can act on |FRAME: CPD-8050| |CITS: [17403152]|. In mammals, |FRAME: CPD-8050| has been shown to localize in the kidney and brain |CITS: [5644141]|, and an enzyme from bovine brain was found to interconvert |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| and |FRAME: CPD-8050| |CITS: [1267771]|.
/
/|FRAME: CPD-8052| is a relatively rare form of inositol. Minor amounts have been found in animal and human tissue sources |CITS: [6643610]||, and it has been shown that |FRAME: CPD-8052| and |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| are components of two different inositol phosphoglycan (IPG) molecules in mammalian systems |CITS: [2833261][2517463]|. 
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/A pathway for the degradation of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| was initially characterized in |FRAME: TAX-548| |CITS: [5905122][5905123][4328832]|. Since then many microorganisms have been reported to be able to grow on |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| as their sole carbon source, including the yeast |FRAME: TAX-54550| |CITS: [4351258]|.
/
/More recent studies in |FRAME: TAX-1423| have identified multiple genes required for |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| catabolism. The <i>iol</i> divergon includes the operons <i>iolABCDEFGHIJ</i> and <i>iolRS</i> |CITS: [9226270]|, and the <i>iolT</i> gene |CITS: [11807058]|. Seven of these genes encode the enzymes that catalyze the complete degradation of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| to |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE|, |FRAME:ACETYL-COA| and |FRAME:CARBON-DIOXIDE|.
/
/Characterization of the |FRAME: BSU39700|-enoded |FRAME: CPLX-8649| found that the enzyme can also act on |FRAME: CPD-8052| |CITS: [16461681]|. The product of this reaction, |FRAME: CPD-365|, can be converted by the |FRAME: BSU39680|-encoded |FRAME: BSU39680-MONOMER| to |FRAME: CPD-14808|, an intermediate in |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| degradation.
/
/Another study found that |FRAME: TAX-1423| can also grow using |FRAME: CPD-8050| as its sole carbon source |CITS: [20133360]|. The organism possesses two enzymes that can catalyze the conversion of |FRAME: CPD-8050| to |FRAME: CPD-14808|, encoded by |FRAME: BSU33530| and |FRAME: BSU10850|. However, only the NAD+-dependent IolX is involved in |FRAME: CPD-8050| catabolism. The other enzyme, which is NADP+-dependent, may be involved in |FRAME: CPD-8050| biosynthesis |CITS: [20133360]|.

CITATIONS - :EV-COMP-AINF:3499532574:keseler
CITATIONS - 4968608:EV-EXP:3497806599:keseler
COMMENT - Pulcherrimin was first identified as a red pigment produced by the yeast <i>Candida pulcherrima</i> (also known as <i>Torula pulcherrima</i> or <i>Torula rubefaciens</i> |CITS: [16559644]| and later renamed <i>Metschnikowia pulcherrima</i>) when it is grown on media containing iron salts |CITS: [16589308]|.  Pulcherrimin is a ferric complex of pulcherriminic acid.  Oxygen is required for pulcherrimin formation |CITS: [ROBERTS]|.
/
/It was noted early that pulcherrimin can also be produced by spore-forming bacteria, including <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> |CITS: [16589308]|, and the requirement for oxygen was confirmed |CITS: [4968608]|.  Pathways for the biosynthesis of pulcherriminic acid were investigated |CITS: [5837792][4204912]|.
/
/The enzymes involved in the synthesis of pulcherriminic acid have only recently been identified.  A cyclodipeptide synthase utilizes charged tRNAs as the source of amino acids for generating the cyclo-<i>L</i>-Leu-<i>L</i>-Leu cyclic dipeptide intermediate |CITS: [19430487]|.  This compound is then oxidized by the cytochrome P450-family enzyme CypX |CITS: [20690619]|.
